# disk

- persistent data storage device regardless of machine state. HDD are mechanical and as such wear over time. slower than SSDs which read/write data electionically.

# ram

- random access memory.
- volatile memory, data is erased on shutdown
- typically smaller in size compared to disk drives since it is more expensive. however reading and writing to ram is significantly faster than disk.

# cpu

- central processing unit, the brain, intermediary between ram and disk.
- read/writes to/from ram and disk.
- executes code, after compiling, reads and executes binary instructions stored in ram, which may involve manipulating data in either ram or disk.
- all computations done in cpu.
- cache is part of cpu

# cache

- faster memory than ram, but even less storage
- whenever a read operation is requested, cache is checked before ram and disk. unchanged data will be read from cache rather than ram/disk.
- web browsers use a cache to store data of frequently accessed pages, including html, css, js, images etc. if data is still valid, page will load faster.
