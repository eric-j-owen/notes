#### Understand the Problem
- Questions to ask yourself:
	- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
	- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
	- What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
	- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Aka do I have enough information to solve the problem?
	- How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
#### Explore Examples
- Come up with concrete examples to understand problem better.
- Steps:
	- Start with simple examples with input and output. Write it down.
	- Progress to more complex examples.
	- Explore edge cases
		- empty inputs
		- invalid inputs
#### Break the Problem Down
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take before writing any code.
#### Solve/Simplify
- If you can't solve the big problem, solve a simpler problem.
	- Break the problem down to simpler problems and solve what you know. 
	- Ask for suggestions or go through what you think if you really can't solve a problem. 
#### Refactor 
- Questions to ask: 
	- Can you check the result?
	- Can you derive the result differently?
	- Can you understand it at a glance?
	- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
	- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
	- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
	- How have other people solved this problem?
