[[DSA]]

- Describes the relationship between the input size and runtime.
- Usually refers to worst case scenario. 

$O(1)$  
$O(log n)$  
$O(n)$  
$O(n*log n)$  
$O(n^2)$  

#### space complexity
- most primitives (booleans, numbers, null) are constant space.
- strings require $O(n)$ where n is length
- reference types are generally $O(n)$ where n is length or number of keys.
