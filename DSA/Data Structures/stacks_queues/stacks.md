# Stacks

- LIFO
  - Last In First Out
  - think about a stack of plates
- use cases
  - Managing function invocations
  - undo / redo
  - routing (history object) is treated as a stack
- in a stack, push and pop should be constant time
- implimentation can be done with a linked list or just arrays
  - typically better than using arrays since indexes

## Big O

- insertion O(1)
- removal O(1)
- searching O(n)
- access O(n)
