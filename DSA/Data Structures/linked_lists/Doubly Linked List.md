[[DSA]]

Consists of nodes and each node has a value and pointer to both the next and previous node. Contains a head, tail and length property.

insertion - $O(1)$ better than arrays since arrays need to be reindexed
removal - $O(1)$ this is better than a singly linked list.
searching - $O(n)$
access - $O(n)$

doubly linked lists are more efficient in certain operations such as pop when compared to singly. however it takes up more memory. more memory === more flexibility.
